#  McGregor-Mayweather odds continue to narrow

As the August 26th date for the Conor McGregor-Floyd Mayweather fight creeps nearer, so do the betting odds of who will win. McGregor, who has never had a professional boxing match before this one, is currently a slight underdog at +450 (bet $100 to win $450). Mayweather, on the other hand, is sitting pretty at -650.

But those odds have been narrowing rapidly in McGregor’s favor in recent weeks as more and more people are betting on him. In fact, some sports books have already stopped taking bets on the fight altogether, because the odds have gotten so skewed in McGregor’s direction.

What could be causing this dramatic swing? Some believe that it has to do with public sentiment shifting in McGregor’s favor ever since he knocked out Jose Aldo – one of the most dominant champions in UFC history – in just 13 seconds back in December 2015.

Since then, McGregor has become even more of a household name, and many are starting to see him as not just a dirty fighter but an actual contender against Mayweather. After all, he is taller and has a longer reach than Mayweather. He also doesn’t seem afraid to talk trash to his opponent – something that Mayweather is definitely not used to.

Whether or not this shift in sentiment will actually translate into an upset victory for McGregor remains to be seen. But it will certainly be interesting to see how things play out come fight night.

#  Money Mayweather remains favorite over Conor McGregor

When Floyd Mayweather and Conor McGregor meet in the ring on Saturday night, money will be on the mind of many people. The undefeated Mayweather is a -550 favorite, meaning you would need to bet $550 to win $100. McGregor is a +375 underdog, meaning if you bet $100, you would win $375.

Mayweather is coming off a 2-year retirement and is looking to make another $200 million or more. McGregor has never boxed professionally but has been training for this fight since early 2016.

A few sportsbooks are taking bets on how long the fight will last. The over/under is set at 10 rounds with the over paying out at +135 and the under paying out at -170. A knockout or technical knockout would end the fight in Round 9 or earlier and pay out at +325 while going the distance would payout at -450.

Mayweather is considered one of the best boxers of all-time and has never been knocked down in his professional career. McGregor does have knockout power, but he’s up against an opponent who has never been defeated. It’s hard to see anyone other than Mayweather winning this fight.

#  McGregor's unique style could give him an edge over Mayweather

Conor McGregor is one of the most unique fighters in the world. He doesn't have the typical boxing style that you would expect from someone who is fighting Floyd Mayweather. This could give him an edge over Mayweather, who is more of a traditional boxer.

McGregor's style is based more on movement and unpredictability. He likes to move around the ring and use his agility to avoid his opponent's punches. He also likes to throw a lot of punches, which can catch his opponent off guard.

Mayweather is a more traditional boxer who relies on his defense and counterpunching. He isn't as agile as McGregor and he won't be able to move around the ring as easily. This could leave him open to McGregor's punches, which could result in a knockout victory for McGregor.

Of course, this is all just speculation at this point. We won't know for sure who will win until they step into the ring on August 26th. But if you're looking for an underdog to bet on, Conor McGregor is your best bet.

#  Las Vegas sportsbooks take a hit as public bets come in on McGregor

Las Vegas sportsbooks take a hit as public bets come in on McGregor. As the fight between Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather Jr. nears, the betting public has overwhelmingly sided with McGregor, causing sportsbooks to take a financial hit.

The MGM Grand took in about $1 million less in bets than it had anticipated on the fight, with 75% of all bets being placed on McGregor. William Hill’s Nevada sportsbook took an even bigger hit, with 90% of all bets being placed on McGregor and costing the company $1.2 million.

It’s not just Las Vegas sportsbooks that are feeling the impact of the flood of public bets on McGregor; offshore sportsbooks are also taking a beating. Betting website SportsBettingDime reports that McGregor is currently a -450 favorite (meaning you would have to wager $450 to win $100), while Mayweather is a +325 underdog.

Some experts are predicting that sportsbooks could lose as much as $10 million on this fight, as the general consensus seems to be that McGregor doesn’t have a chance of winning. The fact that such sizable sums are at stake is likely motivating many bettors to put their money on McGregor, despite his significant disadvantage in terms of odds.

#  UFC champ predicts upset, Mayweather to lose by knockout

UFC welterweight champion Tyron Woodley is predicting an upset for the ages in the upcoming Floyd Mayweather-Conor McGregor fight - with Mayweather losing by knockout.

In a recent interview on FOX Sports 1, Woodley said that McGregor has the ability to "box and move" and that he will eventually wear down Mayweather, leading to a knockout victory for the UFC Lightweight Champion.

This isn't the first time that Woodley has made waves with his predictions - he also predicted that Andre Ward would defeat Sergey Kovalev in their November 2016 showdown.

While many boxing experts are hesitant to back McGregor because of his lack of experience in the ring, Woodley is confident that his fellow countryman will come out on top.

"I believe Conor McGregor’s going to win by knockout," Woodley told TMZ Sports. "He’s not going to outbox Floyd Mayweather, but I think he’s going to land something clean and hurt Mayweather."

It will be interesting to see how this plays out, as Mayweather is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time, while McGregor is making his professional boxing debut.
