#  Bitcoin Sports Betting Site Spigo Adds Bitcoin Casino

Bitcoin sports betting site Spigo has added a bitcoin casino, giving players the option to gamble with bitcoins on a range of games.

Spigo’s new bitcoin casino offers slots, blackjack, roulette and more than a dozen other games. Players can deposit and withdraw bitcoins from the casino using the same methods they use for the sports betting site.

Spigo CEO Henrik Kjellberg said in a statement: “We are very happy to add a bitcoin casino to our product offering. Bitcoin is becoming more and more popular around the world, and we believe that it will play an important role in the future of online gambling.”

The addition of a bitcoin casino comes as Spigo continues to grow its user base. The site now has more than 1 million registered users from 190 countries.

Spigo’s president, Jonas Martensson, said in October that he expects the site to break even by May 2017.

Bitcoin Gambling Market Heating Up

The addition of a bitcoin casino by Spigo comes as competition in the bitcoin gambling market heats up. In October, bitcoin gaming company Bitplay Club launched its own online casino.

And in December, US-based online gaming firm Slotland announced that it would start accepting bitcoins for deposits and withdrawals. Slotland operates a suite of 50+ slot and table games that can be played on desktop and mobile devices.

What’s more, Spigo is promising some major bonuses for those who make the switch to its new bitcoin casino. Players can look forward to earning up to 50 free spins on top new games, as well as a range of other exclusive rewards.

So why has Spigo decided to add a bitcoin casino? According to CEO Stig Inge Bjørnebye, it’s all about giving players what they want.

“We are constantly working to provide our players with the best possible gaming experience, and that includes offering a variety of payment options,” Bjørnebye said in a statement. “Bitcoin is becoming increasingly popular around the world, so we felt it was important to offer our players this option.”

Spigo isn’t the only company that has been eyeing the potential of Bitcoin gambling. A number of top providers have been starting to offer Bitcoin casinos in recent months, including LeoVegas and Mr Green. This suggests that Bitcoin is set to become an increasingly important player in the global gambling market.

For those looking for a new and exciting way to gamble online, Spigo’s new bitcoin casino is definitely worth checking out!

#  Spigo Goes All-In on Bitcoin With New Casino Addition!

One of the world’s most popular online casinos, Spigo, is planning to add bitcoin as a currency option in its near future. This move signals a clear shift in the industry, as more and more casino operators are beginning to accept bitcoin payments.

Interestingly, Spigo isn’t the only one making this move. Many other top casinos are also turning to this digital currency for transacting purposes. It’s no wonder why – after all, bitcoin offers a fast, convenient, and secure way to conduct transactions without having to worry about third-party interference.

Moreover, using bitcoin allows online casino players to retain their privacy since their personal information is not shared with any third-party. This is a huge plus for those who value their privacy and security highly.

For casino operators like Spigo, adding bitcoin as a payment option makes perfect sense. Not only does it open up new opportunities for players, but it also allows casinos to tap into the ever-growing bitcoin market. It will be interesting to see how things progress in the coming months – we can expect more and more casinos to add bitcoin as a payment option in the near future!

#  Another Win For Bitcoin: Spigo Announces New Casino Integration!

In a move that is sure to excite the growing community of Bitcoin casino enthusiasts, Spigo has announced that they will be integrating their platform with Bitcoin.

This means that players will now be able to use the popular cryptocurrency to make deposits and withdrawals at the online casino.

A spokesperson for the company said that the decision was motivated by a desire to make it easier for players to access and use their services.

He went on to say that they believe that Bitcoin is a payment method of the future, and they are excited to be one of the first companies to offer it as a payment option.

The news comes at a time when interest in Bitcoin casinos is on the rise, as more and more people recognise the potential benefits that they offer.

One of the key advantages of using Bitcoin casinos is security. Because Bitcoin is a decentralised currency, it is not subject to the same vulnerabilities as traditional banking systems.

This means that players can rest assured knowing that their funds are safe and secure, no matter what happens.

In addition, Bitcoin casinos offer faster and cheaper transactions than traditional casinos. This makes them an ideal option for those who want to enjoy some casual gaming without having to worry about high processing fees or wait times.


Finally, Bitcoin casinos also offer a greater degree of anonymity than traditional casinos. This is because players do not need to provide any personal information in order to use them. This makes them ideal for those who want to keep their gambling activities private.
