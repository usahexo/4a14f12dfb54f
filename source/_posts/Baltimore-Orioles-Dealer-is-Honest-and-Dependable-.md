#  Baltimore Orioles Dealer is Honest and Dependable 

The Baltimore Orioles are a professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland. The Orioles compete in the American League East division of Major League Baseball.

The Orioles were established as a charter member of the American League in 1901. They are the only major league franchise located in Baltimore, and one of three remaining original AL teams (the Boston Red Sox and Chicago White Sox are the others).

The Orioles have won two World Series championships: one in 1966 and one in 1970. They also lost the 1983 World Series to the Philadelphia Phillies, four games to one. After 14 consecutive losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, they made a playoff appearance in 2012.

#  Baltimore Orioles Dealer is Known for his Integrity 

The Baltimore Orioles are a Major League Baseball (MLB) team located in Baltimore, Maryland. The Orioles were founded in 1901 as the Milwaukee Brewers and became the St. Louis Browns in 1902. The team moved to Baltimore in 1954 and officially became the Orioles that season. They are a member of the American League East division.

The Orioles have had some great players over the years, including Cal Ripken Jr., Eddie Murray, and Brooks Robinson. The team has also had its share of controversy. In 1990, outfielder Danny Heep was released from the team after being caught using a corked bat. More recently, in 2017, pitcher Zach Britton was traded to the New York Yankees after being accused of violating baseball's drug policy.

Despite these controversies, the Orioles have been one of MLB's most successful franchises. They have won three World Series championships (1966, 1970, and 1983), six American League pennants (1954, 1966, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1979), and seventeen division titles (1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1983, 1997*, 1998*, 1999*, 2012*).

One of the things that has helped the Orioles maintain their success is their strong farm system. For many years they were known as a "feeder" team that supplied other clubs with talented prospects. Some of their most famous graduates include Mike Mussina (New York Yankees), Jim Palmer (Baltimore Orioles), Curt Schilling (Philadelphia Phillies/Arizona Diamondbacks/Boston Red Sox), and Mark Reynolds (Colorado Rockies/Arizona Diamondbacks/Cleveland Indians/St. Louis Cardinals).

The current owner of the Baltimore Orioles is Peter Angelos. Angelos purchased the team in 1993 for $173 million. He is a well-known trial lawyer and has been involved in various legal cases throughout his career. In 1996 he was listed as one of America's 100 Most Powerful Lawyers by National Law Journal . 

Angelos is also known for his strong principles and integrity. In 2003 he refused to sign off on a trade that would have sent pitcher Erik Bedard to the Boston Red Sox for shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. Garciaparra was considered one of baseball's top players at the time and Bedard went on to become one of MLB's best pitchers. 

While Angelos has made some unpopular decisions during his tenure as owner of the Orioles (e.g., firing manager Davey Johnson after winning the 1997 World Series), he is largely respected by fans and baseball pundits alike for his dedication to running a clean organization and for his loyalty to Baltimore."

#  Baltimore Orioles Dealer always Plays by the Rules 

The Baltimore Orioles have a long history of playing by the rules. They have been one of the most consistent teams in baseball, making the playoffs 14 times in their history. One of the main reasons for their success is their focus on doing things the right way.

This starts with their manager, Buck Showalter. He has always been a stickler for detail, and ensures that his players play with integrity. This was never more evident than in 2011, when the Orioles had to play a do-or-die game against the Yankees to make the playoffs.

Many people thought that they would fold under the pressure, but Showalter refused to let them take shortcuts. He instilled a sense of discipline in his players, and they played hard until the end. Thanks to his leadership, the Orioles were able to pull off one of the biggest upsets in baseball history.

The Orioles also have a strong front office, which is led by executive vice president Dan Duquette. He has always been focused on building a team that can win year after year, and he has done an excellent job of acquiring talent through both trade and free agency.

The result is a team that is full of hardworking players who are willing to do whatever it takes to win. This was evident earlier this season, when they went on an improbable run and made it all the way to the ALCS.

Itâ€™s clear that the Baltimore Orioles are a team that always plays by the rules. They may not be as flashy as some other teams, but they are a club that you can count on year after year. Thanks for reading!
