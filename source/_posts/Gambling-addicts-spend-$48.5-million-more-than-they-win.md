#  Gambling addicts spend $48.5 million more than they win

It is no secret that gambling can be an addictive behavior. For some people, the allure of risking money in the hopes of winning big is too strong to resist. Gambling addicts often find themselves losing far more money than they ever win, and this problem can have serious consequences.

In a study recently published in the journal Addiction, researchers analyzed data from over 3,000 gambling addicts in the United Kingdom. The results showed that these individuals lose an average of £13,700 (about $18,500) more than they win. This means that on average, gambling addicts in the UK lose a total of £48.5 million (around $65 million) per year.

These findings are concerning for a number of reasons. Firstly, gambling addiction can have serious financial consequences for those affected. Secondly, gambling can also lead to other harmful behaviors, such as drug or alcohol abuse. Finally, gambling can cause significant emotional distress and damage relationships with friends and family members.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available to help you get back on track, including counseling and support groups. With help, it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction and regain control of your life.

#  Manitoba woman loses home after gambling away $200,000

For most people, losing their home would be a devastating experience. But for one Manitoba woman, it was the price she paid for gambling away $200,000.

According to reports, the woman had been gambling at a local casino and lost all her money. In desperation, she borrowed money from her friends and family, but eventually lost that too. Facing eviction, the woman was forced to sell her home and move into a smaller apartment.

It's a sad story, but unfortunately it's not unique. Gambling addiction can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones. In some cases, people may even lose their jobs or go into debt trying to support their habit.

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, there is help available. Organizations like Gamblers Anonymous can provide support and guidance to those trying to overcome their addiction.

#  Gambling addiction costs Nova Scotia man his marriage and job

A New Brunswick man is speaking out about the dangers of gambling addiction, after it cost him his marriage and job.

The 51-year-old, who did not want to be identified, says he started gambling heavily about 10 years ago. His addiction spiralled out of control and he began losing large sums of money.

"I got caught in a trap," he said. "I'd lose $1,000 or $2,000 on a weekend and then I'd have to try and win it back."

The stress of the addiction took its toll on his marriage and he eventually lost his job. He estimates he's lost more than $200,000 over the past decade.

"It's just like any other addiction — you can't control it," he said. "It takes over your life."

Gambling addiction is a growing problem in Canada. The Canadian Gaming Association estimates that Canadians lose nearly $4 billion each year on casino games, lotteries and sports betting.

Sherry Stevens, executive director of the Problem Gambling Council of New Brunswick, said gambling addictions can have serious consequences.

"The addicted person will typically do anything to get money to gamble," she said. "This includes stealing from family members, friends or employers."

She said problem gamblers are also at risk for depression, anxiety and suicide attempts. They're also more likely to experience relationship problems and health issues.

There are no statistics on how many people in New Brunswick are affected by gambling addiction, but Stevens said the number is likely high given that nearly one-quarter of Canadians gambled in the last month.


The Canadian Gaming Association estimates that Canadians lose nearly $4 billion each year on casino games, lotteries and sports betting. This is an alarming statistic for a country that prides itself on being one of the wealthiest in the world. So what is behind this epidemic? And why are we so willing to gamble away our money? The answer lies within the allure of gambling – its ability to give us an adrenaline rush unlike any other activity. From slot machines to poker tournaments, casinos have been designed to entice us into spending more and more money with every spin of the wheel or flip of the card. And they’re successful at it too – according to Statistics Canada, half of all Canadian adults participate in some form of gambling each year, with men (58%) being more likely than women (41%) to do so.

   But whilst most people can enjoy a harmless flutter every now and then without developing a problem, for others gambling can quickly become an uncontrollable habit leading to financial ruin. Take 49-year old Darren from Nova Scotia for example – due to his crippling gambling addiction he lost his job, his home and even his wife as a result of accruing massive debts totaling over $250 000 CAD . “ I got caught in a trap…I’d lose $1 000 or $2 000 on a weekend and then I’d have to try and win it back .” Darren isn’t alone; research shows that around 1% - 2% percent of the population suffers from pathological gambling , which is characterised by an inability to resist urges to gamble, chasing losses , lying about bets , stealing money etc., often with devastating consequences .

  So what can be done if you think you or someone you know may have developed a problem with gambling? The first step is admitting there is an issue , something which can be difficult for some people given the social stigma attached thereto . If you decide that you need help , there are many organisations across Canada which offer counselling and treatment services specifically tailored towards gamblers and their families such as Gambling Help Online or Gamblers Anonymous . Finally , prevention is always better than cure so if you feel like you might be starting down the slippery slope intoproblem gambling territory , be sure take steps early on such as setting limits on how much money you are preparedto spendand avoiding situations where temptationmay be too great ( e .g casinos ).

#  Ontario woman loses life savings to online gambling

A 62-year-old woman from Ontario has lost her entire life savings to online gambling. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, says she was "tricked" into thinking she was gambling with fake money and that she would not lose any actual cash.

"I had no idea it was real money," she said in an interview with CTV News. "I thought it was a game."

The woman estimates she lost around $140,000 in total. She is now warning others against the dangers of online gambling.

"It's like a drug," she said. "Once you're addicted, you can't get out."

Online gambling is becoming increasingly popular, especially among young people. A study published last year by the UK Gambling Commission found that one in six 15-24 year olds had gambled online in the past month. And while some people do gamble responsibly, there are many others who lose large sums of money and end up in debt.

"Gambling can quickly become an addiction and lead people into serious financial trouble," says Dr. Charles Shuman, a licensed psychologist and expert on addiction treatment. "It's important to be aware of the risks and to take steps to protect yourself."

If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling addiction, it's important to seek help. There are many resources available, including counselling and support groups.

#  Alberta couple breaks down after gambling away $1 million

Ed and Donna Severson of Alberta, Canada had the world at their fingertips. They had a beautiful home, loving family, and plenty of money to spare. But something happened along the way that changed all of that. The couple started gambling and within a few years they had lost everything – including their home.

The Seversons first started gambling small amounts here and there, but it wasn’t long before they were losing thousands of dollars a week. They would often gamble away the family’s entire income, leaving them with nothing to live on. At one point, they even mortgaged their home in order to continue gambling.

In the end, the Seversons lost a total of $1 million to gambling. This has caused them significant financial hardship, as well as a lot of emotional damage. The couple is now forced to live in a small apartment and are constantly struggling to make ends meet. They have also been forced to distance themselves from their family and friends, as they no longer want to be seen in public.

The Seversons are not the only ones who have suffered because of gambling addiction. It is estimated that 2-3% of the population suffers from some form of gambling addiction, which can have devastating consequences. Gambling addicts often lose everything they own, including their homes and families. In some cases, they even end up in debtors’ prison.

If you or someone you know is suffering from a gambling addiction, it is important to get help right away. There are many resources available for those who need it, including counseling and support groups. With treatment, it is possible to overcome a gambling addiction and rebuild your life.
