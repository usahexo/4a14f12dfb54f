#  Hawks Down Celtics In Season Opener Behind Strong Play From Schroder

The Atlanta Hawks opened their 2017-2018 NBA season with a bang, knocking off the Boston Celtics 111-96 behind 24 points and 10 assists from Dennis Schroder.

Schroder was electric, slicing through the Celtics defense at will and finding open teammates for easy buckets. He was helped out by a balanced scoring attack that saw four other Hawks score in double figures. Taurean Prince led the way with 17 points on 7-of-10 shooting, while Ersan Ilyasova and Kent Bazemore each scored 16 points.

Boston was led by Kyrie Irving, who had 23 points on 8-of-15 shooting. Jaylen Brown added 15 points for the Celtics, but it wasn't enough to overcome the Hawks' firepower.

The win is a good sign for Atlanta, who are looking to rebound from a disappointing 2016-2017 season. Schroder is expected to take on an even bigger role this year, and he looked more than up to the task against Boston. If he can continue to play at this level, the Hawks could be in for another playoff run.

#  Atlanta Hawks Rout The Miami Heat 123-99

With one of the most complete performances of the season, the Atlanta Hawks routed the Miami Heat 123-99.

The victory was led by All-Star forward Paul Millsap who recorded 27 points and 12 rebounds. Point guard Jeff Teague added 20 points and 8 assists, while center Al Horford chipped in 16 points and 8 rebounds.

Dwyane Wade led the way for the Heat with 24 points, but no other player scored more than 14. The loss drops Miami to fourth place in the Eastern Conference standings, a half game behind Cleveland.

Atlanta got off to a quick start, scoring 37 points in the first quarter. That was more than they had scored in any single quarter all season. The lead reached 38 points midway through the third quarter and Atlanta cruised to the easy win.

The Hawks improve to 33-29 on the season and remain in seventh place in the East, two games behind Boston for sixth place. They continue their three-game road trip on Wednesday night against Philadelphia.

Miami falls to 36-25 and drops to fourth place in the East. They host eighth-place Detroit on Wednesday night.

#  NBA Picks: Atlanta Hawks At Milwaukee Bucks

The Atlanta Hawks (20-16) visit the Milwaukee Bucks (21-14) on Friday night. The Hawks are in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, while the Bucks are in third place.

Atlanta is led by point guard Trae Young, who is averaging 19.8 points and 8.5 assists per game. He is joined in the starting lineup by shooting guard Kent Bazemore, small forward Taurean Prince, power forward John Collins, and center Dewayne Dedmon.

Milwaukee is led by point guard Eric Bledsoe, who is averaging 17.3 points and 5.2 assists per game. He is joined in the starting lineup by shooting guard Malcolm Brogdon, small forward Khris Middleton, power forward Giannis Antetokounmpo, and center Brook Lopez.

The Bucks are a better team than the Hawks and should win this game. Antetokounmpo is one of the best players in the NBA and will lead Milwaukee to victory.

#  Hawks Exercise Fourth Year Option On Schroder

The Atlanta Hawks have exercised the fourth year option on guard Dennis Schroder, according to a team release.

Schroder, 24, averaged a career-high 19.4 points and 6.2 assists while shooting 44.9 percent from the field and 36.1 percent from three-point range in 2017-18. He was also one of just five players in the NBA last season to average at least 19 points and six assists per game.

#  NBA Eastern Conference Preview: Atlanta Hawks

The Atlanta Hawks had a very successful season last year, finishing the regular season with the best record in the Eastern Conference. However, they were ultimately defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs.

This year, the Hawks are looking to make a return trip to the playoffs and go even further. Here’s a look at their roster:

Point Guards: Jeff Teague and Dennis Schröder

Shooting Guards: Kyle Korver and Kent Bazemore

Small Forwards: Paul Millsap and DeMarre Carroll

Power Forward: Mike Scott and Elton Brand

Center: Al Horford

The strength of this team lies in its balance. They have a lot of good players at every position, which makes them difficult to matchup against. Point guard Jeff Teague is coming off of a good year and should continue to play well. The shooting guard position is strong with Kyle Korver and Kent Bazemore. Both players can shoot the ball extremely well, which will open up the floor for the rest of the team. Power forward Mike Scott had a breakout year last season and should continue to be a force on offense. The biggest question mark for this team is center Al Horford. He is coming off of an injury and it is unclear if he will be able to return to his previous form. If he can get back to 100%, the Hawks will be one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference.
