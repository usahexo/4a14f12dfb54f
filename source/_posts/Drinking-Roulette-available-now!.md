If you’re looking for a party game that will get everyone excited and ensure plenty of laughs, Drinking Roulette is the perfect choice. It’s easy to set up and can be played by any number of people – perfect for gatherings with friends or family over the Christmas period.

To play, all you need is a set of shot glasses (one for each player) and a spinner. The spinner can be made using a paper clip and a pen, or you can buy a ready-made Drinking Roulette spinner online.

Players take it in turns to spin the spinner, and then drink the shot glass indicated by the arrow. Players must drink in order from lowest number to highest number. If players are caught drinking out of order, they must drink another shot. The game is over when the final player has finished their shots.

Drinking Roulette is great fun for all ages and can be adapted to suit different groups. For example, if some players want to drink more than others, you can make the game more challenging by awarding extra shots for spinning a higher number on the spinner. Or, if you’re playing with younger players, you could make it a rule that they can only drink water or soft drinks instead of alcohol.
