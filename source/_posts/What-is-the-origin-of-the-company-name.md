#  What is the origin of the company name?

The origins of the company name are disputed, but there are two predominant stories. The first story is that the founder and CEO of the company, Jack Dorsey, was on a date with a woman named Crystal and he was trying to come up with a name for his company. He reportedly sent a tweet to her asking for name suggestions and she replied “Twitter”. The second story is that Jack was sitting in a cafe with his business partner Evan Williams and they were brainstorming names for the company. A bird landed on the window sill and they both said “Twitter” at the same time.

Whichever story is true, it’s clear that Twitter has an interesting history!
