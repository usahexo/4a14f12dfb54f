#  Sports Betting Pushes Nevada Gaming Revenues to Record Levels

_Nevada casinos raked in a record $11.15 billion in gaming revenue in 2017, helped largely by a surge in sports betting, according to new state figures released Thursday._

__

Casinos statewide reported taking $1.3 billion in bets on sporting events last year, an increase of more than 316 percent from the $288 million wagered in 2016. The amount wagered is second only to the $1.5 billion bet in 2007, when the NFL season coincided with the start of legalized sports betting in Nevada._

__

Nearly all of the growth came after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning most sports betting outside of Nevada in May. Since then, six additional states have legalized some form of sports gambling._

"The industry has reacted very quickly to the Supreme Court decision," said Michael Lawton, senior research analyst with the Nevada Gaming Control Board. "Sports books have expanded their facilities, increased their marketing and raised their limits for bettors."_

#  Sports Wagering Accounts for Half of All Casino Gambling Revenue in Nevada

Casino gambling is a big business in the United States. In fact, it’s estimated that Americans wagered more than $240 billion on casino games in 2017. This translates to an average of more than $1,000 per person.

While casino gambling is popular nationwide, there are some states where it’s particularly popular. Nevada, for example, is home to Las Vegas – the unofficial capital of American casino gambling. In 2017, casino gambling revenue in Nevada totaled $11.2 billion. This means that casino gambling accounted for more than half of all gambling revenue in the state.

What explains Nevada’s high popularity for casino gambling? There are likely a number of factors at play, but one key reason is that Nevada is one of only a few states where sports betting is legal. In fact, sports wagering accounted for more than $500 million of the state’s casino gambling revenue in 2017.

This shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise given the popularity of sports betting nationwide. In 2017, Americans wagered more than $10 billion on sports betting – a figure that has been growing rapidly in recent years. The increased interest in sports betting can be attributed to a number of factors, including the advent of online sportsbooks and the growth of mobile betting apps.

With sports betting becoming increasingly popular, it’s likely that casino gambling revenue in Nevada will continue to grow in the years ahead. This will be good news for the state’s casinos, which have seen their profits decline in recent years as competition from other states has increased.

#  Casinos in Las Vegas Earn More from Sports Betting Than from Slot Machines

The days of casinos in Las Vegas relying on slot machines for the majority of their income are long gone. In fact, according to a recent report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board, casinos in the city earned more from sports betting in July 2018 than they did from slot machines.

This is a significant change from even just a few years ago, when slots were by far the biggest moneymakers for casinos. In July 2014, for instance, sports betting accounted for only 4.8% of casino income in Las Vegas, while slot machines brought in more than twice that amount.

What’s behind this shift? One major factor is the legalization of sports betting in Nevada in 1951. Over time, as other states have legalized sports betting, too, the market has become increasingly competitive – and lucrative – for casinos. In 2017, for example, gambling revenue from sports bets totaled $248 million in Nevada, up from $164 million just two years earlier.

Meanwhile, revenue from slots has been declining steadily in recent years. This is due in part to increasing competition from online gambling but also to changes in how casinos operate. Today, many casinos rely less on slots and more on table games like blackjack and roulette, which typically offer better payouts to players.

So does this mean that you should give up on slot machines altogether and focus exclusively on sports betting? Certainly not! Slot machines still account for the majority of casino revenue nationwide and can be quite profitable if played correctly. But if you’re looking to maximize your chances of winning big bucks while gambling in Las Vegas, it’s definitely worth considering putting some money down on the latest sporting event too.

#  More Money is Wagered on Sports than on any Other Type of Gambling Activity


Las Vegas is often thought of as the gambling capital of the world. It should come as no surprise, then, that more money is wagered on sports than on any other type of gambling activity. In fact, the amount of money bet on sports each year is estimated to be in the billions of dollars.

There are a number of reasons why people wager on sports. Some people do it simply for the excitement and adrenaline rush that comes with betting on games. Others view sports betting as a way to make some extra money. And then there are those who believe that sports betting is a way to beat the system and make a profit even when their team loses.

No matter why people bet on sports, there is no doubt that it can be a very profitable venture. However, it is also important to note that sports betting can be quite risky, especially if you are not familiar with how it works. Here are a few tips to help you get started:

1) Do your research - Before placing any bets, it is important to do your research and learn as much as you can about the teams involved and the odds for each game. This will help you make informed decisions about which bets to place and increase your chances of winning money.

2) Start small - It is always a good idea to start small when betting on sports. This will help you learn the ropes and avoid losing too much money in the process.

3) Use reliable sources - When looking for information about upcoming games, it is important to use reliable sources such as reputable news websites or established sports publications. This will help avoid making costly mistakes by betting on games that you know little about.

4) Stay disciplined - One of the biggest pitfalls for many people who bet on sports is greediness. It is important to remember that it is possible to lose money just as easily as you can win it, so don't go overboard with your bets and try to stay disciplined at all times.

#  The Amount of Money wagered on Sports in Las Vegas is Increasing

Las Vegas has been a popular destination for those looking to spend their money on sports for many years. The amount of money wagered on sports in Las Vegas is increasing, however. In 2017, the total amount wagered was $5.15 billion. This is up from the $4.8 billion wagered in 2016.

This increase can be attributed to the legalization of gambling in several states throughout the country. This has led to an increase in the number of people who are placing bets on sporting events. The legal states include New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Rhode Island.

There has also been an increase in the number of sports that are being bet on. In addition to traditional sports such as football and basketball, people are now betting on eSports events and other niche sports. This has led to a greater variety of wagers that can be placed on individual games or tournaments.

The growth in gambling is not only limited to Las Vegas. Gambling operators throughout the United States are reporting increased revenue from sports betting. This is especially true of mobile betting platforms, which have seen a surge in popularity over the past year or so.

The increased interest in sports betting is not without its drawbacks, however. There have been calls for tighter regulation of gambling in the United States due to concerns over addiction and corruption. Whether these concerns will lead to any meaningful changes remains to be seen.
