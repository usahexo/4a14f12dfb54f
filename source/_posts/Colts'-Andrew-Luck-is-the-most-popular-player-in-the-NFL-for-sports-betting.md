#  Colts' Andrew Luck is the most popular player in the NFL for sports betting

There is no doubt that Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck is one of the most popular players in the NFL. Heading into the 2017-2018 season, Luck has had a strong fan following both on and off the field.

Interestingly, Luck’s popularity extends beyond just fans of the Colts. In fact, he is considered to be one of the most popular players in NFL for sports betting. This is evidenced by the fact that Luck frequently appears as one of the top players listed in betting odds for both individual and team games.

For example, at the time of this writing, Luck was listed as a 3/1 favorite to win this year’s Super Bowl. This puts him well ahead of other quarterbacks such as Tom Brady (7/1) and Aaron Rodgers (10/1). He was also listed as a 6/5 favorite to win the AFC Championship, ahead of players such as Brady (13/8) and Ben Roethlisberger (11/4).

What makes Luck so popular with sports bettors? There are likely several factors at play.

First, Luck has been very successful on the field since entering the NFL in 2012. In addition to leading the Colts to three playoff appearances, he has also thrown for over 4,000 yards in three different seasons.

Second, Luck also seems to have a good attitude off the field. He generally comes across as a likeable guy who is respected by his peers. This may help him attract bettors who are looking for a player to back whom they believe will perform well both on and off the field.

Finally, it is worth noting that Luck has consistently beaten the NFL betting odds during his career. In fact, he is currently one of only five quarterbacks in NFL history who have never lost an opener (against the point spread). This may give bettors confidence that they are making a smart decision when they place a wager on him.

All things considered, it seems that Andrew Luck will continue to be one of the most popular players in NFL for sports betting for years to come.

Andrew Luck is one of the most popular players in the NFL for sports betting. The Colts quarterback is coming off of an injury-plagued season, but he is still a top option for bettors.

Luck has thrown for over 4,000 yards in each of his first six seasons in the NFL. He also has a career touchdown-to-interception ratio of 2.5:1. That makes him one of the most consistent quarterbacks in the league.

Luck’s popularity extends beyond the United States. He is also a popular option for bettors in Europe and Asia. In fact, Luck was one of the most popular players to bet on during the 2018 World Cup.

The biggest reason for Luck’s popularity is his ability to lead his team to victory. The Colts have had some down years recently, but Luck always seems to put up a fight. Bettors can usually rely on Luck to give them a chance to win their bet.

Luck is also a good value bet most of the time. His odds are usually between +200 and +300, which gives you a good chance to make some money if he wins.

Unfortunately, Luck’s injury history could cause some bettors to shy away from him this season. However, if he can stay healthy, he should be one of the best options in the NFL once again.



#  Indianapolis Colts have one of the most popular players in the NFL for sports betting
The Indianapolis Colts have one of the most popular players in the NFL when it comes to sports betting, and that player is quarterback Andrew Luck. In fact, the Colts' Luck is so popular that he often finds himself near the top of the list of players who are most likely to win the Super Bowl.

The Colts have made it to the playoffs only twice during Luck's five-year career, and they have yet to make it to the Super Bowl. Nevertheless, fans continue to bet on Luck and the Colts in hopes of cashing in on some big payouts.

One reason why Luck is so popular with sports bettors is that he is capable of putting up big numbers both through the air and on the ground.

This makes him a threat to score points any time he takes the field, which is why many bettors believe that he has a good chance of winning the Super Bowl.

The Colts are not currently considered one of the top teams in the NFL, but that could change this season if they manage to get some good play out of their young defense andLuck stays healthy. If you're looking for a long shot to gamble on this season, then consider putting some money on Indianapolis to make a deep playoff run.
