#  Vegas Casino Workers Threaten Strike If They Don't Win a Huge Perk

Workers in the casino industry are threatening to go on strike if they don't win a huge perk. The perk in question is a new rule that would require casinos to give their employees at least four weeks of paid vacation time.

The rule is being pushed by the Culinary Workers Union, which covers 57,000 casino and hotel employees in Las Vegas and Reno. The union says that its members have been pushing for the rule for years.

"It's about time that the companies recognize that we're not machines," said David White, head of the Culinary Workers Union. "We need some down time."

Casino workers in Las Vegas are currently among the lowest-paid workers in the city. The average hourly wage for a casino worker is just $11 an hour, according to the union.

Many casino owners are opposed to the new rule, saying that it will increase costs and force them to lay off workers. They also argue that it's not necessary, since most casinos already offer their employees paid vacation time.

Union officials say that they're willing to negotiate, but they won't back down on their demand for four weeks of paid vacation time. If a deal can't be reached, they say, workers will begin voting next month on whether to go on strike.

#  Vegas Casino Offers Free Money to Try Out its Real Money Games

Casinos are always looking for ways to attract new customers, and they’re getting more creative all the time. Recently, a casino in Las Vegas offered players free money to try out its real money games.

The promotion was run by the Downtown Grand in partnership with Slotomania, an online casino game. Players could earn up to $100 in free slot play by making a minimum deposit of $20 at the Downtown Grand.

This promotion is a great way to introduce players to real money gambling, and it’s likely to be successful in attracting new customers. It’s also a great way to build loyalty among current players, who may be more likely to return to the casino if they know they can get free money there.

The Downtown Grand isn’t the only casino offering free money these days. Many casinos offer bonuses for signing up or making a first deposit. Others offer rewards for playing certain games or reaching certain levels of play.

There are even casinos that will give you free money just for visiting their site. So before you gamble online, be sure to research the different bonuses and rewards that are available at different casinos. You may be able to get yourself some free cash just for playing your favorite games!
